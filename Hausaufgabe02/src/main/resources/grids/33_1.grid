o1  15  4  5  30 15 1
o2  16  4  13 17 10 2

w12  0  29 999


o1: order with long deadline, high value and low penalty turn

o2: order with medium deadline, medium value and relatively high penalty turn
despite the long deadline the broker will not accept offers with long completion time

o3: order with long deadline, high value and high penalty turn (w11 )

o4: order with long deadline, medium value and zero penalty turn

w11: will only be chosen for the o3. The only way he can get this order assigned is choosing the shortest path (A* test)



We've created this grid mainly to check broker's behaviour on different order types
and lowest worker's offer on o3 (it is located inside kind of a maze and we wanted
to test the A* algorithm we've implemented).

We left additional orders (o1,o2,o3) for just one worker to test the scheduling algorithm (TSP algorithm when the worker has to schedule less than 5 orders).
The worker w12 will be assigned order o1. Then his bid will win on order o4.
He will be moving towards o4 when the o2 will come in. Then he will need to reschedule the order's order to be able to complete o2 within deadline (otherwise his offer will not be accepted).

Broker will lower the deadlines as much ass possible and will not accept bids on which he will not receive a positive score.
